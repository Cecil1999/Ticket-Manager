# Ticket 'Portal'

This CRUD webapp created in Rails 8 was designed as an alternative way of creating, than sending 'tickets' to a 3rd party source. A prelude application which serves as the barebones for my Ticket Manager App.

* Why?

My past employer had a static site similar to this that was created/developed in the 2010s, it had a heap of security vuls and it generally wasn't an easy site to use on any other device than a computer.

In that case, it was limted to only the tech support agents who worked over the phone. So this worked in their case.

Over the span of my employement I had pitched to my boss and the higher ups that if they gave me some time and resources I could have upgraded the site and create some more tools for us in Technical Support. However, those were shot down.
